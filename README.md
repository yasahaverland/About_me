# About me

![My intro Banner](https://i.imgur.com/3eQ49DD.jpg)

I am a creative-minded, solutions-driven software developer with a passion for intuitive design and function. As a parent we learn that functionality is key to our day to day life, and as an artist, I just can’t let go of an aesthetic pleasing design. Driven to create interactive products shaped around human experience, expression, and intuitive, efficient functionality. As mentioned before, I’m a proud mom and I’m also passionate about animation and music. I enjoy meeting new people and learning about new cultures.
